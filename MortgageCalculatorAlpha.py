# ### Mortgage Calculator  
# Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).

# ## Functions  
# ___  
# >**- npv  (rate, values)**  *Returns the NPV (Net Present Value) of a cash flow series.*  
# **- pmt  (rate, nper, pv[, fv, when])**  *Compute the payment against loan principal plus interest.*  
# **- ppmt (rate, per, nper, pv[, fv, when])** *Compute the payment against loan principal.*  
# **- pv   (rate, nper, pmt[, fv, when])** *Compute the present value.*  
# **- rate (nper, pmt, pv, fv[, when, guess, tol, â€¦])**  *Compute the rate of interest per period
